<h1>Greetings weary traveller!</h1>

    <p>This website serves as a portfolio for myself. This website should serve as an invaluable rescorce that will (hopefully if everything works) help shed some light into who I am, what I am qualified to do, what I enjoy and a way for anyone to get in contact with me.
        Please understand that this is a work in progress, and as I learn more about Web design, I will be changing things, adding animations, ect.
    </p>
    <h2>Therefore! Please sit back, relax and enjoy the site!</h2>
