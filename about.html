    <h1>Come sit and lend an ear to my tale</h1>

    <p>
        Once upon a time in a barren land known as South Africa, was a young man named Joshua Levi Visser born.
        I had no clue of the dangers, challenges, torments and temptations awaited me in this world... Mostly because 
        I was a fucking <b><u>BABY</u></b> and didn't know anything. 
        <br>
        Regardless, I grew up as a humble farm boy. Working the land...watching my father work the land...I never really
        worked the land. I WAS A CHILD! Anyway, after 6 years of living on a farm, completely ignorant of my 
        parents objective poverty, we decided to move to the city.
        <br>
        Living in the city was a major adjustment. I was roughly 10 years of age at the time of moving and was
        completely and utterly unprepared for the sheer level of pompus rich-kid vibes. Despite being amongst them,
        I never really found my place.
        <br>
        Blah blah blah why am I typing this crap? I just want to see if the relative links of the webpages work.
